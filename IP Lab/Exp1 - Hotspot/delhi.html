    Delhi, India’s capital territory, is a massive metropolitan area in the
    country’s north. In Old Delhi, a neighborhood dating to the 1600s, stands
    the imposing Mughal-era Red Fort, a symbol of India, and the sprawling Jama
    Masjid mosque, whose courtyard accommodates 25,000 people. Nearby is Chandni
    Chowk, a vibrant bazaar filled with food carts, sweets shops and spice
    stalls
